#this is a comment it is a single line comment

'''to add multi line

comments we use

tripe quotes '''

#print("hello guys how are you ")

#now see the magic from now

print("hey guys ")
print("how are you")

#now we use one function called end refer notes for more

print("hey guys",end=(""))
print(" how are you ")
#by using this end we can bring the other print statement into the same line
#now lets talk about escape sequence characters

print("c\himesh") #works fine

print("\nhimesh") #will skip a line after the letter c and will start with himesh again so this / represents a escape sequence character

#all types of escape sequence characters are shown in my notes refer them
